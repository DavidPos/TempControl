#TempControl

![Photon Setup](https://github.com/DavidPos/TempControl/blob/master/Photos/IMG_5420.jpg)

Creating a temperature controller using Particle Photon to allow control via Wifi. The final product should be allow the user to add heating elements or cooling elements and allow the user to get alerts if something goes wrong.



##First Phase
First phase will be to create the temperature set up to link a temperature sensor to the photon board and then display that temperature on a android device.

## Second Phase
Expand on first phase  by adding a relay circuit to control a light that will turn on when the temperature sensor gets to a set temp.
